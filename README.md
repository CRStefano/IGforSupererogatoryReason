# IGforSupererogatoryReason
An application of the IG criterion taken from Shannon's information theory to capture in theory which reasons (p) are decision-making and which are supererogatory for a conclusion to be explained (q).

# ATTENTION, THERE IS ONE IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE:
“Knowing how to read”

#Instructions

- NOMDLv3.py = New version of the program with changes to the greedy algorithm and threshold. Various bugs, duplicate codes, have been fixed and it now works with all CSV sizes (I have implemented new GUI, settled partition of code which gave errors if used incorrectly. It's practically finished, but I'd like to add the possibility that the program will detect if the "q" (which we gave it) is incorrect. (Perhaps the CSV column doesn't have the same parameters as the input, or the program will warn you if it doesn't make sense to look for the explanation in that particular data...)).
- NOMDLv3.7z = This is the zip file containing the executable with a graphical interface. It will ask you for .csv files to insert. I have given you three, but you can insert whatever you want (if you have Excel files, don't worry, they are fine, just convert them!). (only for windows, The Mac version will be available soon.)
- The other three files are CSV datasets that I used to test, tweak, and correct everything. Feel free to use them.
- docum_NOMDLv3.md = I added documentation of all the steps and program choices.
