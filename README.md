#Instructions

- NOMDL.PY = program written in Python that applies the model. Feel free to modify it, but please cite me...
- NOMDL.ZIP = This is the zip file containing the executable with a graphical interface. It will ask you for .csv files to insert. I have given you three, but you can insert whatever you want (if you have Excel files, don't worry, they are fine, just convert them!).
- The other three files are CSV datasets that I used to test, tweak, and correct everything. Feel free to use them.
