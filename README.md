#Instructions

- NOMDL.PY = (old)program written in Python that applies the model. Feel free to modify it, but please cite me...
- NOMDL.PYv3 = New version of the program with changes to the greedy algorithm and threshold. Various bugs have been fixed and it now works with all CSV sizes (I'll leave the old one here if you want to see the changes I've made).
- NOMDL.ZIP (old) = This is the zip file containing the executable with a graphical interface. It will ask you for .csv files to insert. I have given you three, but you can insert whatever you want (if you have Excel files, don't worry, they are fine, just convert them!).
- NOMLv3.ZIP = new exe of the program (only for windows, The Mac version will be available soon.)
- The other three files are CSV datasets that I used to test, tweak, and correct everything. Feel free to use them.
